‚ö° Vector Search Optimization Strategy
Performance Improvements
1.	Pre-computed Embeddings
2.	# Cache common financial concept embeddings
3.	FINANCIAL_CONCEPTS = [
4.	    "emergency fund", "systematic saving", "compound interest",
5.	    "inflation impact", "goal-based planning"
6.	]
7.	# Pre-embed and store in ChromaDB
8.	Semantic Chunking
9.	# Chunk financial content by concept, not arbitrary length
10.	def semantic_chunk_financial_content(content):
11.	    # Use financial keywords to create meaningful chunks
12.	    # Ensure each chunk is self-contained concept
13.	Hybrid Search Implementation
14.	def optimized_search(query, top_k=5):
15.	    # Combine semantic similarity + keyword matching
16.	    semantic_results = chroma_collection.query(query_embeddings=[query_embed])
17.	    keyword_results = text_search(query)
18.	    return merge_and_rank(semantic_results, keyword_results)
19.	Response Caching
o	Cache responses for common questions
o	Use Redis for session-based context
o	Implement smart cache invalidation
